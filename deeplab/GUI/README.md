### GUI:
* A GUI was created for live demo. 
* The GUI consists of options to choose the dataset variant and the encoder of DeepLabv3+. 
* A live video is displayed from which an image can be captured for segmentation.
* The captured image can then be segmented and the GUI shows a visualization of the infered segmentation mask and also displays a overlay of the mask on the image.
